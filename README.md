# TypeScript Learning

This repository records my notes and practicing projects in learning TypeScript.

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## 1. Notes

My learning Notes are included in _Notes.md_.

- The notes are composed with a structure that starts from the basics of TS and then goes into the depth such as decorators.
- You might need some JavaScript experience to not only know how to code in TS but to understand the mechanisms behind.

## 2. Drag & Drop Project

[CodePen Project](https://codepen.io/uujx/pen/PoNYwOg)

A Drag and Drop project for practicing TypeScript.

- You can create project with title, description and number of poeple involved.
- Projects are divided in to two lists: active projects and finished projects.
- You can drag a project from a list and drop it to the other.
